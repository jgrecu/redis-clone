# REDIS Clone -- Build your own Redis (CodeCrafters)

Redis is an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, message broker and streaming engine. In this challenge I'll build my own Redis server that is capable of serving basic commands, reading RDB files and more.

Along the way, I'll learn about TCP servers, the Redis Protocol and more.
